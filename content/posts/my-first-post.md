Hey.

Its been a while.

A long time ago (more than two years ago? ish?), I bought this domain with the intent to write about the things I love most: eating, running, and coding. Like most side projects, buying the domain was about as far as it went.

Yes, there _were_ some posts there. However, most of them were either copied from my old Tumblr, which was really just a copy of my old Blogger page. You'll also notice that those posts aren't present in this incarnation of my blog. This is because I'm starting out fresh - giving myself that "instant gratification" by mass-importing old posts would probably doom this blog to another year of neglect. And we dont want that, do we?

So what will I (probably) be posting about?

## Eating

I love food. All of it. Everything from kale smoothies to deep-fried candy bars.

I don't love Soylent. Never drink Soylent.

I'll post recipies, reviews, and pictures of the foods that I love and discover. And no; the Mtn. Dew Jello post isn't coming back. It wasn't as good as I made it sound (it actually kinda sucked and looked like pee).

## Running

Running is one of my favorite things to do. For me, its like meditation. I focus mainly on long distances (>= 26.2 miles).

This section will be a general training log. I may also mix in some gear reviews or race reports.

## Coding

During the day, I pretend to be a software engineer at a company called Imagine Learning. Here is where I should also note that this is _my_ blog, and is not representative of my employer.

But really, I'm jsut a professional Googler who has become very good at fooling people. *And they pay me for it!* I'll share the interesting discoveries I find, and hopefully some updates on side projects as they spin up.

## But Really

I'm glad to be back. I look forward to more posts and especially more _consistent_ posting. I'll see you soon!
