<p>Hey.</p>

<p>Its been a while.</p>

<p>A long time ago (more than two years ago? ish?), I bought this domain with the intent to write about the things I love most: eating, running, and coding. Like most side projects, buying the domain was about as far as it went.</p>

<p>Yes, there <em>were</em> some posts there. However, most of them were either copied from my old Tumblr, which was really just a copy of my old Blogger page. You&rsquo;ll also notice that those posts aren&rsquo;t present in this incarnation of my blog. This is because I&rsquo;m starting out fresh - giving myself that &ldquo;instant gratification&rdquo; by mass-importing old posts would probably doom this blog to another year of neglect. And we dont want that, do we?</p>

<p>So what will I (probably) be posting about?</p>

<h2 id="eating">Eating</h2>

<p>I love food. All of it. Everything from kale smoothies to deep-fried candy bars.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t love Soylent. Never drink Soylent.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post recipies, reviews, and pictures of the foods that I love and discover. And no; the Mtn. Dew Jello post isn&rsquo;t coming back. It wasn&rsquo;t as good as I made it sound (it actually kinda sucked and looked like pee).</p>

<h2 id="running">Running</h2>

<p>Running is one of my favorite things to do. For me, its like meditation. I focus mainly on long distances (marathon or longer).</p>

<p>This section will be a general training log. I may also mix in some gear reviews or race reports.</p>

<h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>

<p>During the day, I pretend to be a software engineer at a company called Imagine Learning. Here is where I should also note that this is <em>my</em> blog, and is not representative of my employer.</p>

<p>But really, I&rsquo;m jsut a professional Google-searcher who has become very good at fooling people. <em>And they pay me for it!</em> I&rsquo;ll share the interesting discoveries I find, and hopefully some updates on side projects as they spin up.</p>

<h2 id="but-really">But Really</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to be back. I look forward to more posts and especially more <em>consistent</em> posting. I&rsquo;ll see you soon!</p>
