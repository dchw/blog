      <description>Hey.
Its been a while.
A long time ago (more than two years ago? ish?), I bought this domain with the intent to write about the things I love most: eating, running, and coding. Like most side projects, buying the domain was about as far as it went.
Yes, there were some posts there. However, most of them were either copied from my old Tumblr, which was really just a copy of my old Blogger page.</description>
